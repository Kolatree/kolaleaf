// ReceiptViewModel.swift  (Phase 7 · U50 → iter-2 C2/W9/W12/S2/S6)
// Pure derivation over a completed `Transfer` + its resolved
// `Recipient`. The receipt is the terminal screen of the Send flow:
// big check, "Money's home", amount, summary card, share + send-
// another CTAs.
//
// Iter-2 fixes:
//   • C2 / OO-001: AUD/NGN formatting via shared `AmountFormatter`.
//   • W9 / ADV-P7-W3: nil + zero-rate receiveAmount renders "—" so
//     the receipt never shows ₦0 on a still-settling transfer.
//   • W12 / ADV-P7-W6: precondition transfer.status is COMPLETED or
//     NGN_SENT — construction with any other status is a programming
//     error (we'd be celebrating a failure).
//   • S2 / OO-007: `savingsLine` → `savingsLineCopy` so the name
//     reflects that it's static copy, not a derived figure.
//   • S6 / ADV-P7-S1: send-another debounce — fires at most once.
